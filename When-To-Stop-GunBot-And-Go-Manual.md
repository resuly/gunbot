 When To Stop GunBot And Go Manual
---------------------------------------

 ***So the dump is here and the Bollinger Band didn't support you enough. Had You been spending hours on the troll box and probably got banned a couple of hours because you wanted to talk about the dump and hump, isn't it? Ok, I'll show you how to stop your GUNBOT without losing money (or losing just a little part of it if you really want to...i don't!).***


 - Rule of thumb (and kinda obvious): take a note of target price to sell in your GUNBOT price updater. If you can't find it, scroll back to the last buy order: there is the last price, the target buy price and the target sell price (picture below):

 - now go to your poloniex dashboard and place a sell order of all your coins at the selling price that GUNBOT gave you
 - stop your GUNBOT
 - start your GUNBOT again or, as an alternative, let it go if you don't want to trade on that pair anymore.

 >  When do you need to do this? Only when you see your coin falling down and then stabilizes on a lower price for a while AND you have an open buy order at poloniex book: it will eventually recover later but you would loose a lot of trades at the new lower level. Some dumbs would sell at market price: I do not suggest it unless all devs of your coin just announced an exit scam


Example

**Q.:** Help! I accidentally closed my GUNBOT while a buy order was on the book!

 **A.:** Go at your poloniex dashboard and look at your trades: multiply the buy price per 1,25% (or whatever Margin to sell you put in the configurator +0.25% as poloniex fee). That's the selling price. Place a manual order to sell all your coins at that price. Start GUNBOT again.

**Q.:** I have a sell order on the book, how to stop GUNBOT?

 **A.:** Just shut down your GUNBOT, no further actions needed: poloniex will continue to keep your sell order until fulfilled and then it's over on that pair.
