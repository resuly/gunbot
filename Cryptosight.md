## Introduction:
CryptoSight is a trade and profitability tracker built to work within Telegram. It works to show your profits, track and alert you to trades as they are made, as well as provide a platform for creating trades. This guide will walk you through the steps required to get you going.

## Step 1.
CryptoSight requires API Keys from your Exchange of choice, and your Gunbot License Reseller will provide you with a CryptoSight Activation Key. You will need to create a new API Key Pair with READ permissions \(at minimum\). If you wish to use CryptoSight to make trades, you must also enable Trading / Orders. 

For detailed instructions on how to create API Keys, please consult your exchange’s FAQ or Help section.

## Step 2.
When you have created a new API Key Pair, save the Public and Secret API Keys in a safe place. Since this application is communicating directly to the Exchange to READ data, it will require BOTH KEYS.

## Step 3.
Using Telegram, send a direct message __“/start”__ to @Gunthy\_bot.

## Step 4.
Download the __“activation_form.txt”__ and edit it with a text, or code editor.

## Step 5.
Insert the CryptoSight License Key provided to you by your Gunbot Reseller on the line matching:

\[LICENSE KEY\]
KEY = _insert-your-license-key-here_

## Step 6.
Insert your Public and Secret API Keys in the fields below the name of your chosen exchange:

```
[POLONIEX]
# API = INSERT YOUR PUBLIC API KEY HERE
# SECRET = INSERT YOU SECRET API KEY HERE

[BITTREX]
# API = INSERT YOUR PUBLIC API KEY HERE
# SECRET = INSERT YOU SECRET API KEY HERE

[BINANCE]
# API = INSERT YOUR PUBLIC API KEY HERE
# SECRET = INSERT YOU SECRET API KEY HERE
```

## Step 7.
Remove the # from in-front of the API Keys of your chosen exchange:

```
[BINANCE]
API = exampleexampleexample
SECRET = exampleexampleexampleexampleexample
```

## Step 8.
Save the file and upload it to the __@Gunthy\_bot__ chat window.

## Step 9.
Upon successful linking, your exchange will be displayed, along with a prompt to upload past trading history. \*\*If your account is starting fresh, you can skip this step\*\*

## Step 9 \(or skipping Step 8\).
After uploading your trade history, or skipping by typing __“/start”__, you will either get a verification like below:

And your control keyboard will show up, or you will see the keyboard after typing __“/start”__ if you skipped the upload of your trade history, like below:

![step09b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2372008/34905990-172b2958-f864-11e7-87d1-f5c9d1491ff4.png)

## Step 10.
Your CryptoSight bot is completed, and you can now utilize the features available to you. Enjoy!
