## Tips and advice
> DON'T USE YOUR RENT MONEY TO FEED THE BOT! -Diesel

> Time Will Tell and Sell  -Tim S

> I STRONGLY recommend that everyone have a seperate trading account that you use for testing purposes.  When you want to try different settings or a new version of Gunbot comes out, having a small seperate pool of money to test with can be invaluable before making changes to your main Gunbot accounts.  -Krypto

> When figuring out how much to set your "TRADING_LIMIT" to a good rule of thumb is Base Pair Amount / (2x Number of Pairs)  This way when the bear markets come (and they will!) You won't eat up all your available base currency and will have options for bagging and/or averaging.

> Turn DOUBLE_UP false until you know what that setting does and when/how to use it properly.
